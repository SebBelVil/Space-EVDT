# Space-EVDT
Author: Sebastian Belanger Villanueva
This repository contains the code developed as part of a Master's thesis at MIT / EPFL.
The thesis was conducted within the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. 
Note: to reproduce thesis results, use 2025-12-05 data.

## Overview
The project implements an Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology (EVDT) framework
applied to space sustainability and orbital risk.

## Structure
- `Main.ipynb`: Main execution notebook
- `src/`: Supporting functions
- `data/`: Supporting data

## Disclaimer
This code is provided for academic and research purposes.

## Usage
To use the code, simply open the main.ipynb notebook and interact with the user interface. 

## Requirements
Some features require API keys to fetch the latest data from:
- Celestrack SOCRATES
- ESA DISCOSweb
- Space-Track
- Semantic Scholars
Note that existing files in the data folder allow users to run the code without fetching the latest available data.
